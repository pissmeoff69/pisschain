## About Pisschain

**Pisschain** is not just a cryptocurrency. It's a *bodily-fluid-powered revolution*. Designed from scratch while someone was in the bathroom, it's peer-to-pee(r), fully saturated, and vaguely decentralized (we're still drying the roadmap).

## 🚽 Features

### 💦 **Proof of Soak and Time™**
Our consensus model rewards those who commit storage AND bladder capacity. The wetter your hard drive, the better your block odds.

### 🧑‍🌾 **Moist Farmer GUI & CLI**
Designed for humans and moderately intelligent bidets. Thousands of nodes already flushing on mainnet.

### 🔧 **PissSeeder™**
A DNS-based node discovery service, powered by the sheer audacity of naming a protocol after a bodily function.

### 📉 **Small On-Chain State**
Like your dignity after explaining Pisschain to your family.

### 🔤 **Lisp-style PeeLang™**
A Turing-complete language built for financial contracts and moist expressions like:
```lisp
(flush (if full (drain wallet)))
```

### 🔐 **BLS Keys**
Big Leaky Signatures™ with aggregation so efficient we only need **one** signature per block, unless someone gets excited.

### 🫧 **Puddling Protocol**
Like pooling, but with more splashing and less centralized control. Be your own puddle.

### 📱 **Light Clients**
Sync faster than a panic pee before a job interview. No full node? No problem—our light clients only need 2 drips and a timestamp.

### 🌍 **Global Community**
Enthusiasts in over 40 countries, 3 urinals, and 1 submarine.

## 🛠 Requirements

- **Python 3.9+** (we tried to run it in 2.7, but it just leaked memory and actual fluid)
- A hard drive
- A soft bladder

### Check Your Python Version
```bash
python3 --version
```

### Check Your Hydration Level
```bash
echo "Do you need a bathroom break?" | grep -i yes
```

## 🔐 Network Configuration

### NAT, UPnP, TCP, and You

If you're behind a NAT (Non-Absorbent Toilet), peers can't find your node. Fix this by:

1. Enabling UPnP on your router
2. Sacrificing a water bottle to the latency gods
3. Forwarding TCP port 8444
4. Praying

## 🧻 What Should I Install?

### Most people need:
- **Harvesters** (they collect yellow plots)
- **Farmers** (they cultivate splash)
- **Plotters** (write the soggy plots)
- **Full Nodes** (for full flow)
- **Wallets** (to contain the leak)

### Do NOT install:
- **Timelords** (unless you're into quantum urinals)
- **VDFs** (Very Damp Functions)
- **PissSeeder** (unless you know how DNS, plumbing, and magic work)

---

## 🔧 Installation

> ⚠️ **Warning**: There's no website. There's no GUI installer. You're on your own. You probably found this repo because you googled something you shouldn't have.

But hey, you're here now. Might as well hydrate and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pissmeoff69/pisschain
cd pisschain
. ./activate
```

---

## 🚀 Running

Once installed, run the following command and follow the trickle of logs:

```bash
pisschain start
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: If you see errors, that's normal. If you see water, unplug your machine immediately.
