💦 pisschain-blockchain 💦
Welcome to the future of damp digital finance.

Pisschain is not just a cryptocurrency. It’s a bodily-fluid-powered revolution. Designed from scratch while someone was in the bathroom, it’s peer-to-pee(r), fully saturated, and vaguely decentralized (we’re still drying the roadmap).

🚽 Features include:
💦 Proof of Soak and Time™: Our consensus model rewards those who commit storage AND bladder capacity. The wetter your hard drive, the better your block odds.

🧑‍🌾 Moist Farmer GUI & CLI: Designed for humans and moderately intelligent bidets. Thousands of nodes already flushing on mainnet.

🔧 PissSeeder™: A DNS-based node discovery service, powered by the sheer audacity of naming a protocol after a bodily function.

📉 Small On-Chain State: Like your dignity after explaining Pisschain to your family.

( ) Lisp-style PeeLang™: A Turing-complete language built for financial contracts and moist expressions like (flush (if full (drain wallet))).

🔐 BLS Keys: Big Leaky Signatures™ with aggregation so efficient we only need one signature per block, unless someone gets excited.

🫧 Puddling Protocol: Like pooling, but with more splashing and less centralized control. Be your own puddle.

📱 Light Clients: Sync faster than a panic pee before a job interview. No full node? No problem—our light clients only need 2 drips and a timestamp.

🌍 Global Community: Enthusiasts in over 40 countries, 3 urinals, and 1 submarine.

🛠 Requirements:
Python 3.9+ (we tried to run it in 2.7, but it just leaked memory and actual fluid).

A hard drive.

A soft bladder.

To check your Python version:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 --version
To check your hydration level:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Do you need a bathroom break?" | grep -i yes
🔐 NAT, UPnP, TCP, and You:
If you're behind a NAT (Non-Absorbent Toilet), peers can’t find your node. Fix this by:

Enabling UPnP on your router

Sacrificing a water bottle to the latency gods

Forwarding TCP port 8444

Praying

🧻 What Should I Install?
Most people need:

Harvesters (they collect yellow plots)

Farmers (they cultivate splash)

Plotters (write the soggy plots)

Full Nodes (for full flow)

Wallets (to contain the leak)

Do not install:

Timelords (unless you’re into quantum urinals)

VDFs (Very Damp Functions)

PissSeeder (unless you know how DNS, plumbing, and magic work)

🔧 Installing
There’s no website. There’s no GUI installer. You’re on your own. You probably found this repo because you googled something you shouldn’t have.

But hey, you're here now. Might as well hydrate and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/pissmeoff69/pisschain
cd pisschain
. ./activate
🚀 Running
Once installed, run pisschain start and follow the trickle of logs. If you see errors, that’s normal. If you see water, unplug your machine.

If you’ve made it this far, you’re either a pioneer or dangerously curious. Either way, welcome to Pisschain. It’s gonna be a wild leak.
